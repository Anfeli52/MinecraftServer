§3Bro this §fBeyond §eAscension §3pack was kinda easy to finish.

§2Finish? You do know that wasn’t the end, right?

§3What do you mean? I just reached "The End", these are the credits!

§2That’s "The End", not *the end*. Have you even been to The Pit?

§3The Pit? What’s that supposed to be?

§2That’s the real endgame, bro.

§3But I didn’t see any quests about that… must’ve been forgotten by the devs or something.

§2What devs this is still made by just one dev. And besides, it looks like you haven’t even killed Ultra Sniffer, Day Stalker & Night Prowler, Kamath… or any of the other end-game bosses. And you think you’re done?

§3Well… I mean… kinda…

§2No excuses. Go handle that first. Then you’ll *really* see what’s waiting for you.

§3Alright… guess I’ll go check it out.

§3It can’t be harder than the Ender Dragon.

§2Oh, you’ll see...

















§9Hope you you're having fun in the pack :D
